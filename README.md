## The First Days

Once you have crafted your Sedimentary Friend™ Pet Rock™, open the box to release your new pet into the world.

Box contents include:
- 1 Pet Rock™, untrained
- 1 Booklet, *Pet Rock: Care and Training*

Be sure to read the booklet carefully, as it includes detailed information for the care, feeding, and training of your Pet Rock™.

Pet Rocks™ are known to be very sensitive, and may have been traumatized by its sudden newfound sentience. It is advised to keep the rock on you at all times for a period of at least 3 to 4 days so it can form a lasting bond with its new owner.

Failing to properly care for your Pet Rock™ may result in your rock developing symptoms that include, but are not limited to, lethargy, low body temperature, rough skin, shortness of breath, hair loss, missing extremities, confusion, and nausea.

## Training Your Rock

You can train your rocks to perform tricks for the amusement of you and your friends! Some simple tricks include Sit, Stay, Turn Around, and Play Dead.

You can even train your Pet Rock™ to perform more advanced tricks such as Attack, Combust, and Roar. These advanced tricks may require your pet to have access to certain item props or catalysts.

For more details, consult the included booklet, *Pet Rock: Care and Training*.

## Rock Breeding

Since the Paleolithic era, humans have been over-harvesting wild rocks and displacing them from their natural habitats. Some rocks have even been transported from other planets so they can be imprisoned and put on display.

With a small amount of training, you can become a certified Rock Breeder™! All it takes is two rocks, a few pieces of flint, some torches, C418 music, a few moments to set the mood, and you will soon find yourself in the presence of a brand new baby Pet Rock™!
